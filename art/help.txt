## help.txt was made at the time of v0.2.3.
## Some things may have changed since then.

Main menu:
    Start Server
        # Attemps to start the server.
        # If the server is already started, it'll attemp to stop the one currently running, and then start the new one.  This made it easier to test when making changes, so not to have to exit XBMC / Kodi.
    Stop Server
        # Attemps to fetch the url "/stopserver" to activate the server's stop feature.  This made things easier, so not to have to either exit or restart XBMC / Kodi.

Add-on Settings:
    Player Core
        # ['AUTO','DVDPLAYER','MPLAYER','PAPLAYER']
    Port number
        # Default: 8025
        # Remember to shutdown one, before changing this port if you got one currently running.  As it makes use of this port number when attempting to shutdown the server currently running.
    IP Address
        # Should be left blank (ie: ''), for now.
        # Seems to work over the network.
        # Seems to not work over the internet.  In my case, this may be a lack of port-forwarding.
